                    The Nursing Home Support Scheme also known as “Fair Deal” is operated by the Health Service
                    Executive (HSE). It gives financial support to those who need long term nursing home care. Under the
                    Scheme, the person who needs long term residential care in a nursing home (the Resident) contributes
                    to the cost of their care. The State then pays the balance through the HSE. The cost of care is
                    shared between the Resident and the HSE based on an assessment of their income. This assessment is
                    based on their savings and the value of their residential or other property.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>How does the application process work?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>In order to apply for the scheme, you must be an ordinary resident of the state. Ordinary resident
                    means that you have been living in the state for at least a year or that you intend to live in
                    Ireland for at least a year.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Step 1 - There is a care needs assessment that identifies whether you need long term care or not.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Step 2 - This is the application for State Support. A financial assessment will determine the
                    contribution to your care and your corresponding level of financial assessment.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Step 3 - Ancillary state support is the legislative term for the nursing home loan. This aspect of
                    the scheme is optional.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The application form should be completed and signed by the person applying for nursing home care.
                    However, in certain cases, another person may apply on their behalf. Additional documentation will
                    be required to support each application.
